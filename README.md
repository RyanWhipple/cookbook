# CookBook

## Features
- Create recipes, complete with photo, ingredients, directions, notes
- Make a recipe and then share the results!  Results include a photo and description of how it turned out.  These appear as an album below the relevant recipe
- Activity feed shows the last several recipes and results posted
- Ability to follow other users and see who is following you
- User profile shows albums of the users results and recipes

## Coming Soon
- Privacy and relevance filters:
-- Filter by posts by users you're following to make results more relevant
-- Keep your posts public or restrict visibility to followers
-- Go one step further and make your recipes & results completely private, making the app into a personal cookbook
- New and improved layouts to better support both the social media experience and the personal cookbook experience

## Tech Stack
- **Front End:** HTML, CSS, Jinja
- **Back End:** Python on Flask
- **Database:** MySQL with SQLAlchemy
